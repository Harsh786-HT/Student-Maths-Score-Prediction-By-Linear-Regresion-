###### \# 📊 **Maths Score Prediction Using Linear Regression**



###### \##🔹One-Line Summary

A machine learning project that predicts students' mathematics scores using \*\*Linear Regression\*\* based on academic and demographic factors.





###### \## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on predicting students' mathematics scores using a supervised machine learning approach. By applying \*\*Linear Regression\*\*, we analyze how different factors influence academic performance and build a predictive model that estimates math scores accurately.





###### \## ❓ Problem Statement

Student performance is influenced by multiple factors such as study time, prior scores, and background information.

The goal of this project is to **predict mathematics scores** using Linear Regression and understand the relationship between input features and student performance.





###### \## 📂 Dataset

 1. The dataset contains student-related features such as:

  Study hours

  Previous academic performance

  Other relevant attributes

 2.Target variable: **Math Score**

 3.The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and ensure data quality.
